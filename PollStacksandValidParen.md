Let's start with a quiz on stacks and the concept of valid parentheses.

Quiz - Stacks and Valid Parentheses

What is the time complexity of the isValid method in the ValidParenthesis class?
a) O(1)
b) O(log n)
c) O(n) -- Correct Answer
d) O(n^2)

Which of the following strings would the isValid method return true for?
a) "([]{})" -- Correct Answer
b) "([{}])" -- Correct Answer
c) "((])"
d) "}{"

What is the primary role of the Stack in the isValid method?
a) To store all characters in the input string
b) To temporarily hold opening parentheses and match them with closing ones -- Correct Answer
c) To reverse the order of characters in the input string
d) To count the number of each type of parenthesis

In the isValid method, under what condition is false returned immediately?
a) When the stack is empty --  Correct Answer
b) When the stack is not empty
c) When a closing parenthesis doesn't match the top of the stack or the stack is empty
d) When an opening parenthesis is encountered

If you were to modify the isValid method to handle additional types of brackets, such as angle brackets < >, what changes would you need to make?
a) No changes are needed, the existing code can handle any type of brackets
b) Add more if-else conditions to handle the new bracket types -- Correct Answer
c) Change the underlying data structure from a Stack to a Queue
d) Rewrite the entire method from scratch

#Explaination

Excellent! You aced the quiz. You clearly understand the role of stacks in validating parentheses and the time complexity of the algorithm.

**Breakdown of Answers:**

1. **Time complexity:** The `isValid` method iterates through each character in the input string once. For each character, it performs constant-time operations like pushing or popping from the stack. Thus, the time complexity is directly proportional to the length of the input string, making it O(n).

2. **Valid strings:**
    * "([]{})" and "([{}])" have balanced parentheses, so the method would return `true`.
    * "((])" and "}{" have mismatched parentheses, resulting in `false`.

3. **Stack's role:** The stack acts as a temporary storage for opening parentheses. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, it's compared to the top of the stack to ensure they match. This ensures that every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one in the correct order.

4. **Immediate `false` condition:** If the stack is empty when we encounter a closing parenthesis, it means there's no corresponding opening parenthesis to match it with, hence the immediate `false`.

5. **Handling more bracket types:** To accommodate new bracket types like `< >`, you'd need to extend the `if-else` conditions to include checks for these new brackets and their corresponding closing counterparts. The core logic of using a stack remains the same.
