Certainly! I'd be happy to explain space complexity in general and in the context of the `AssignmentFiveHelperMethods` class.

Space complexity is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of its input. It's typically expressed using Big O notation, just like time complexity. Space complexity considers both the auxiliary space (extra space used by the algorithm) and the space used by the input.

In general, space complexity can be categorized as follows:

1. O(1) - Constant space: The algorithm uses a fixed amount of extra space, regardless of input size.
2. O(n) - Linear space: The space used grows linearly with the input size.
3. O(log n) - Logarithmic space: The space used grows logarithmically with the input size.
4. O(n^2), O(2^n), etc. - Various higher-order space complexities.

Now, let's look at the space complexity in the context of the `AssignmentFiveHelperMethods` class:

1. `isValidUsesHelperMethod` method:
   The space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because:
   - A Stack is used to store characters, which in the worst case (all opening brackets) could store all n characters.
   - The input string itself takes O(n) space, but this is typically not counted in auxiliary space complexity.

2. Helper methods (`isOpeningBracket`, `isClosingBracket`, `isMatchingPair`):
   These methods have O(1) space complexity as they use only a fixed amount of space regardless of input size.

3. `run` method:
   This method has O(1) space complexity because:
   - It uses a fixed-size array of test cases.
   - It calls `isValidUsesHelperMethod` for each test case, but doesn't store the results in any growing data structure.

The overall space complexity of the algorithm is O(n), dominated by the `isValidUsesHelperMethod`. This aligns with the comment in the code:

```java
// Space complexity: O(n) in the worst case, where all characters are opening brackets
```

It's worth noting that while the Stack could theoretically grow to size n, in practice, it's unlikely to use that much space for valid parentheses strings, as closing brackets will cause elements to be popped off the stack.

This space complexity is typical for stack-based solutions to the valid parentheses problem and is generally considered efficient. The trade-off for this O(n) space complexity is the ability to solve the problem in O(n) time complexity, which is optimal for this problem.
