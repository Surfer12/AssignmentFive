Let's explore a selection of "easy" algorithms on LeetCode that, like `validParentheses`, benefit from the use of helper methods for better code organization and readability.

**Algorithms & Their Helper Methods**

1. **Palindrome Number (LeetCode 9)**

* **Core Idea:** Determine if an integer reads the same backward as forward.
* **Helper Method:** `reverseInteger(int x)`
   * This method could reverse the given integer, making it easier to compare with the original.
   


2. **Roman to Integer (LeetCode 13)**

* **Core Idea:** Convert a Roman numeral string to its corresponding integer value.
* **Helper Methods:**
   * `romanValue(char c)`: Returns the integer value of a single Roman numeral character.
   * `handleSubtractiveNotation(char current, char next)`: Checks and handles cases like "IV" (4) or "IX" (9) where a smaller numeral precedes a larger one.

3. **Longest Common Prefix (LeetCode 14)**

* **Core Idea:** Find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.bb
* **Helper Method:** `isCommonPrefix(String[] strs, int length)`
   * Checks if the first `length` characters form a common prefix among all strings in the array.

4. **Two Sum (LeetCode 1)**

* **Core Idea:** Find two numbers in an array that add up to a target value.
* **Helper Method (Optional):** `contains(int[] nums, int target, int start)`
   * Checks if the array `nums` contains the value `target` starting from index `start`. (This could be used in a brute-force approach but is less efficient than the common hashmap solution)

**Illustrative Example: Roman to Integer**

```java
public class RomanToInteger {
    public int romanToInt(String s) {
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            int currentVal = romanValue(s.charAt(i));
            if (i + 1 < s.length()) {
                int nextVal = romanValue(s.charAt(i + 1));
                if (handleSubtractiveNotation(s.charAt(i), s.charAt(i + 1))) {
                    result += nextVal - currentVal;
                    i++; // Skip the next character
                } else {
                    result += currentVal;
                }
            } else {
                result += currentVal;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }

    private int romanValue(char c) {
        // ... implementation to get the value of a single Roman numeral
    }

    private boolean handleSubtractiveNotation(char current, char next) {
        // ... implementation to check and handle subtractive cases
    }
}
```

**Key Takeaways**

* Helper methods promote code modularity, making it easier to read, understand, and maintain.
* They encapsulate specific tasks, leading to cleaner logic in the main algorithm.
* They can be reused in other parts of your program if needed.

Let's move onto a short quiz to test your understanding!

**Quiz**

Which of the following is NOT a benefit of using helper methods in algorithms?

a) Improved code readability
b) Increased code complexity
c) Encapsulation of specific tasks
d) Potential for code reuse

**Answer: b) Increased code complexity**

**Short Answer Question**

In the context of the `validParentheses` example, explain how the helper method `isMatchingPair` contributes to the clarity and maintainability of the code.

**Answer:**

The `isMatchingPair` method encapsulates the logic of checking if two characters form a valid pair of opening and closing brackets. This makes the main `isValid` function more focused on the core algorithm of using a stack to track brackets. If the matching logic ever needed to be changed (e.g., to support additional bracket types), the change would be isolated to the `isMatchingPair` method, making the code easier to maintain.
