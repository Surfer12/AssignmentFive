You're right to question this. Let's examine the comment and the code more closely:

```java:AssignmentFiveHelperMethods.java
    // Once the loop finishes the stack should be empty if the string is valid and the brackets are matched to each other in the whole string.
    return stack.isEmpty();
```

This comment is indeed accurate. Here's why:

1. The method pushes opening brackets onto the stack.
2. When a closing bracket is encountered, it's matched with the top of the stack (if possible).
3. If all brackets are properly matched, each closing bracket will have "cancelled out" its corresponding opening bracket on the stack.
4. Therefore, by the end of processing a valid string, the stack should be empty.

The `stack.isEmpty()` check at the end serves two purposes:

1. It catches cases where there are more opening brackets than closing brackets (the stack won't be empty).
2. It confirms that all brackets were properly matched (if matched correctly, the stack will be empty).

So, the comment accurately describes the logic and purpose of this final check. If the stack is empty at this point, it means all brackets in the string were properly matched and closed, making the input string valid.
